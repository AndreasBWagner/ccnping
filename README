ccnpingserver and ccnping are CCNx applications used for testing connectivity.

ccnpingserver
====================

Usage: ./ccnpingserver ccnx:/name/prefix
Starts a ping server that responds to request for Interest name ccnx:/name/prefix/ping/random_number
 -h - print this message and exit
 -x - set FreshnessSeconds


ccnping
====================

Usage: ./ccnping ccnx:/name/prefix
Continously ping a name prefix by sending Interest with name ccnx:/name/prefix/ping/random_number
 -h - print this message and exit
 -c - set total number of pings
 -i - set ping interval in seconds

test connectivity
====================
ccnpingserver is usually run on a hub. For example, on Arizona hub, ccnpingserver is started by running
"ccnpingserver /ndn/arizona.edu". Then we can run "ccnping /ndn/arizona.edu" from other nodes to test
connectivity towards name prefix /ndn/arizona.edu.
