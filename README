ccnpingserver and ccnping are CCNx applications used for testing connectivity.

ccnpingserver
====================

Usage: ./ccnpingserver ccnx:/name/prefix [options]
Starts a CCN ping server that responds to Interests with name ccnx:/name/prefix/ping/number.
  [-x freshness] - set FreshnessSeconds
  [-d] - run server in daemon mode
  [-h] - print this message and exit

ccnping
====================

Usage: ./ccnping ccnx:/name/prefix [options]
Ping a CCN name prefix using Interests with name ccnx:/name/prefix/ping/number.
The numbers in the Interests are randomly generated unless specified.
  [-i interval] - set ping interval in seconds (minimum 0.1 second)
  [-c count] - set total number of pings
  [-n number] - set the number to be used in the Interest
  [-t] - increment the number specified by -n after sending each Interest
  [-h] - print this message and exit

test connectivity
====================
ccnpingserver is usually run on a hub which announces its own name prefix. For example, on the
Arizona hub, ccnpingserver is started by running "ccnpingserver /ndn/arizona.edu". Then other
nodes can run "ccnping /ndn/arizona.edu" to test the connectivity towards /ndn/arizona.edu.
